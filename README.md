# Advanced Security Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Scanner

**A Python-based security tool orchestrator that automates execution of external reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation tools and aggregates their raw outputs.**

## ⚠️ The Honest Assessment

**What This Is:**
- ✅ A tool orchestrator (Python controls Bash tools)
- ✅ An automation framework (systematic execution at scale)
- ✅ A reconnaissance factory (raw data collection)
- ✅ Excellent for pentesters who want to automate repetitive tasks

**What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ A vulnerability scanner in the product sense
- ❌ A deployment gate that blocks releases
- ❌ A risk engine that tells you "fix this first"
- ❌ A deduplicator (same vuln found by 2 tools = 2 findings)

**The Core Reality:**
Your Python code is a **controller**, not a analyzer. It:
- Detects tools
- Installs tools  
- Executes tools
- Captures stdout/stderr
- Saves files

Everything **meaningful** happens in the external tools, not in Python.

This is **valuable infrastructure** but **Phase 1 of a scanner**, not **Phase 2 intelligence**.

## Key Features

### What You Get (Execution Excellence)
- ✅ **32 integrated tools** across 8 categories
- ✅ **325+ individual commands** (not just "run nmap")
- ✅ **Smart orchestration** - each variant gets its own output file
- ✅ **Zero timeout constraints** - tools run to completion
- ✅ **Dual scan modes** - Gate (5-10 min) for quick checks, Full (2-8 hours) for deep dives
- ✅ **Protocol aware** - HTTPS/HTTP variants for everything
- ✅ **Structured logging** - timestamp, correlation ID, execution metadata
- ✅ **Error resilience** - one tool fails, others continue

### What You Don't Get (Intelligence Missing)
- ❌ **Signal extraction** - raw tool outputs, no parsing
- ❌ **Deduplication** - xsstrike + dalfox both find XSS = 2 findings
- ❌ **Correlation** - no "these 3 signals = confirmed RCE"
- ❌ **Risk ranking** - no "fix this first" recommendations
- ❌ **Gate decisions** - no automatic pass/fail for deployment
- ❌ **Normalized schema** - findings not standardized
- ❌ **Confidence levels** - no "this is 95% real vs 30% false positive"

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan a domain (both HTTP and HTTPS)
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com

# Scan with HTTPS only
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com --protocol https

# Scan with specific output directory
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com -o my_assessment

# Auto-install missing tools
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com --install-all
```

### Protocol Selection

```bash
# HTTP only
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com -p http

# HTTPS only
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com -p https

# Both HTTP and HTTPS
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com -p both

# Auto-install all missing tools without prompts
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com --install-all

# Help
python3 automation_scanner.py -h
```

## How It Works

### The 9-Stage Process

**Stage 1: Tool Detection**
### Stage 1: Tool Detection
- Scans for all security tools on the system
- Categorizes by functionality
- Displays install status

### Stage 2: Tool Installation
- Shows missing tools
- Offers interactive installation
- Supports apt, pip, brew, and Go

### Stage 3: Protocol Selection
- Asks user for HTTP/HTTPS preference
- Adjusts URLs accordingly
- Supports auto-detection

### Stage 4: Execution (The Real Work Happens Here)
- Runs 325+ individual commands
- Each command variant gets separate output file
- Captures stdout and stderr with metadata
- Records execution timestamp and correlation ID
- **Note**: This is all external tool output - Python just orchestrates

### Stage 5: Error Handling
- Continues even if tools fail
- Logs all errors  
- Never stops scanning

### Stage 6: Results Aggregation
- Displays tool execution table
- Shows success/fail counts
- Lists execution times
- **What it doesn't do**: Parse outputs, deduplicate, prioritize

### Stage 7-9: Basic Reporting
- Generates JSON report with execution metadata
- Placeholder remediation guidance
- Raw tool output files
- **Important**: This is "what happened", not "what matters"

## Report Examples

### Executive Summary
```
TARGET: example.com
RISK SCORE: 82/100
SEVERITY: CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

TOP FINDINGS:
1. Certificate Expired (CVSS: 7.5)
   → Renew certificate from CA immediately

2. Weak TLS Ciphers (CVSS: 6.5)
   → Configure server to use only strong ciphers

3. SQL Injection Vulnerability (CVSS: 9.8)
   → Implement parameterized queries
```

### Vulnerability Report (JSON)
```json
{
  "target": "example.com",
  "risk_score": 82,
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "type": "Expired Certificate",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "cvss_score": 7.5,
      "description": "SSL certificate has expired",
      "remediation": "Renew certificate from CA",
      "cve": "N/A"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Understanding CVSS Scores

The tool calculates CVSS 3.1 scores automatically:

- **9.0-10.0 (Critical)**: Immediate remediation required
- **7.0-8.9 (High)**: Urgent remediation needed
- **4.0-6.9 (Medium)**: Plan remediation
- **0.1-3.9 (Low)**: Monitor and plan
- **0.0 (Info)**: Informational

## Custom Risk Score (0-100)

- **≥75**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Fix immediately
- **50-74**: 🟠 HIGH - Urgent action needed
- **25-49**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Plan remediation
- **<25**: 🟢 LOW - Monitor

## Supported Tools

### DNS & Subdomain Enumeration
- assetfinder, dnsrecon, host, dig, nslookup, dnsenum
- findomain, sublister, theharvester

### Network Scanning
- nmap, ping, traceroute, whois

### SSL/TLS Analysis
- testssl.sh, sslyze, sslscan, openssl

### Web Application
- whatweb, wpscan, corsy

### Vulnerability Detection

## Troubleshooting

### "Tool not found"
The scanner automatically skips unavailable tools and continues. To install:
```bash
python3 automation_scanner.py example.com --install-all
```

### Permission Denied
Some tools require elevated privileges:
```bash
sudo python3 automation_scanner.py example.com
```

### Timeout Issues
Increase timeout in code or add --timeout parameter if available

### Missing Tabulate Package
```bash
pip3 install tabulate
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use specific categories** instead of full scan:
   ```bash
   # Only DNS (if you create category-specific commands)
   python3 automation_scanner.py example.com --dns-only
   ```

2. **Run during off-peak hours** to avoid overloading target

3. **Increase delays** between tools if needed:
   - Edit `automation_scanner.py` and modify `time.sleep(0.5)`

4. **Use HTTP only** for faster preliminary scans:
   ```bash
   python3 automation_scanner.py example.com -p http
   ```

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Only scan systems you own or have written authorization to test.

- Obtain explicit written permission before scanning
- Use responsibly and ethically
- Respect rate limits and server resources
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Never use on production systems without permission

## Platform Support

- ✅ Linux (Kali, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- ✅ WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- ✅ macOS (with tool installations)
- ❌ Native Windows (use WSL recommended)

## The Next Phase: Building Intelligence

If you want to turn this orchestrator into a **real scanner**, you need:

### Phase 2: Parser Layer (Recommended Next Step)

```python
# New module: finding_parser.py
# Converts tool outputs → standardized findings

class FindingParser:
    def parse_xsstrike_output(self, stdout) -> List[Finding]:
        # Extract XSS findings from xsstrike JSON
        # Return canonical Finding objects
        
    def parse_sqlmap_output(self, stdout) -> List[Finding]:
        # Extract SQLi findings
        
    # ... parsers for all 32 tools

class Finding:
    tool: str              # "xsstrike" 
    type: str              # "xss" 
    url: str               # "https://site.com/search"
    parameter: str         # "q"
    payload: str           # "The actual payload"
    confidence: float      # 0.0-1.0 (how sure?)
    severity: str          # "critical"
    cvss: float            # CVSS score
    evidence: str          # Raw proof from tool
```

### Phase 2B: Deduplication

```python
# New module: deduplication.py

class Deduplicator:
    def dedupe_findings(self, findings: List[Finding]) -> List[Finding]:
        # xsstrike + dalfox both find XSS on /search?q
        # Return 1 finding with both tools listed
        
        # Result:
        # - /search?q has 1 XSS (confirmed by 2 tools)
        # - Confidence: 0.95
        # - Not 2 separate findings
```

### Phase 2C: Risk Engine

```python
# New module: risk_engine.py

class RiskCalculator:
    def calculate_risk(self, findings: List[Finding]) -> RiskScore:
        # Weight by: severity, exploitability, exposure
        # Not just CVSS
        
        # Example scoring:
        # - Exposed admin panel (unauthenticated) = HIGH RISK
        # - Requires authenticated user = LOWER RISK
        # - API-only (not web-facing) = LOWER RISK
```

### Phase 3: Decision Engine

```python
# New module: gate_engine.py

class GateDecision:
    def should_deploy(self, risk_score: RiskScore) -> bool:
        # If critical + exploitable + unauthenticated = FAIL
        # If high + requires admin access = WARN
        # If low + can patch in 24h = PASS
        
        return risk_score < self.deployment_threshold
```

This approach:
- ✅ Keeps your orchestrator as-is (it's working)
- ✅ Adds parsing layer on top
- ✅ Maintains loose coupling
- ✅ Makes findings deduplicated + prioritized
- ✅ Enables actual gate decisions

---

## Contributing

To improve or extend the tool:

1. Test changes thoroughly
2. Update documentation
3. Add new tool functions following the pattern
4. Consider: Are you adding execution coverage or parsing intelligence?

## Support & Issues

If you encounter issues:

1. Check tool outputs in the scan results directory
2. Review `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.txt` for execution status
3. Verify tool installations with `tool_manager.py`
4. Remember: If a tool fails, check its dependencies (this is an orchestrator, not a solver)

### The Truth in One Sentence

> **This is an excellent Python framework for running many external pentesting tools and collecting their outputs. It's not yet a vulnerability scanner or deployment gate, but it's the hard infrastructure that such systems need to be built on top of.**
