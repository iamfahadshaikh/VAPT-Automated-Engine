"""
Architecture Guards - Enforce the 5-step contract

CRITICAL RULES:
1. TargetProfile must be immutable (frozen)
2. DecisionLedger must be built and finalized before execution
3. Every tool execution MUST check ledger
4. Target type determines execution path (no crossing)
5. No bypassing the execution path system
