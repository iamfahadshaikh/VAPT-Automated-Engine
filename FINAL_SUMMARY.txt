================================================================================
                        WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
================================================================================

CLEANUP PROCESS (1.5 hours):

Phase 1: Preparation (5 min)
  - Read EXACT_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md
  - Backup automation_scanner_v2.py
  - Backup target_classifier.py

Phase 2: Update Imports (5 min)
  - Replace old imports with new architecture imports
  - Remove Phase 2/3 import blocks
  - Test: python3 -c "import automation_scanner_v2"

Phase 3: Update __init__ (10 min)
  - Replace TargetClassifierBuilder with ArchitectureIntegration
  - Replace ScanContext with DecisionLedger
  - Remove unused data initialization

Phase 4: Replace run_full_scan() (10 min)
  - Delete old implementation
  - Add routing logic (root/subdomain/IP)
  - Add calls to three new path methods

Phase 5: Add New Methods (15 min)
  - Add _run_root_domain_scan()
  - Add _run_subdomain_scan()
  - Add _run_ip_scan()
  - Add _execute_tool()

Phase 6: Delete Dead Code (20 min)
  - Delete 13 orphaned methods
  - Delete 5 unused data structures
  - Delete unused imports

Phase 7: Delete Duplicate File (5 min)
  - Delete target_classifier.py (entire file)

Phase 8: Validate (10 min)
  - Test root domain detection
  - Test subdomain detection
  - Test IP detection
  - Verify metrics improved

TOTAL TIME: ~1.5 hours

================================================================================
                          HOW TO PROCEED

================================================================================
                        NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS
================================================================================

1. Read START_HERE_INDEX.md (10 min) ← YOU ARE HERE
2. Decide: Quick fix or thorough understanding
3. Read appropriate documents based on decision
4. Proceed with implementation following EXACT_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md

RECOMMENDED STARTING DOCUMENTS:
